## Web-Visualization_RLD
This project will use the data visualizations I have created in the project respository PyWeather_RLD and I will create a web dashboard through an HTML index file.  This activity has been provided by the Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp.


#### -- Project Status: Completed
## Project Intro/Objective
The dataset covers weather information on over 500 unique cities.  Last time, I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to recreate line graphs that show weather patterns.  Now I will use JavaScript to write an HTML index and import the dataset to create a dashboard.

## Project Description
I will be deploying a website that will represent the following. 

* A landing page that will detail the project description and objective.
* A data visualizations section that features a descriptive heading and tile as well as a paragraph outlining the plot significance.
* A comparisions page of the four different scatterplots.
* A data section that outlines the dataset in a table format.

The major challenge will be for me to ensure that every link will route to the appropriate section.  I want to have a complete and operating website running.  The website will be displayed through Github Pages.
